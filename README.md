# Blog - Image Inpainting via Generative Multi-column Convolutional Neural Networks
## Purpose 
Image inpainting is filling in missing or damaged areas of images, which has seen remarkable advancements with the advent of deep learning. This project introduces a novel approach to tackle this challenge. The main purpose of this project is to address the highly ill-posed problem of image inpainting by generating realistic structures and textures.
## Discussion of the architecture 

This project uses a Generative Multi-column Convolutional Neural Network for image inpainting, which synthesizes different image components in parallel within one stage. The ML components, consisting of convolutional neural networks, are responsible for the heavy lifting of feature extraction and pattern generation.

An interactive interface could allow users to specify the areas for inpainting or adjust the level of detail required. This human-in-the-loop approach ensures that the final output aligns with user expectations.
