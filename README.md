# Blog - Image Inpainting via Generative Multi-column Convolutional Neural Networks
## Purpose 
Image inpainting is filling in missing or damaged areas of images, which has seen remarkable advancements with the advent of deep learning. This project introduces a novel approach to tackle this challenge, and users could also use this application. The main purpose of this project is to address the highly ill-posed problem of image inpainting by generating realistic structures and textures.
## Discussion of the architecture 
This project proposed Generative Multi-column Convolutional Neural Network (GMCNN), which is a complex architecture designed to efficiently address the challenges of image inpainting.  Now, what does that mean? Imagine you have a damaged or incomplete photo that you'd like to fix or complete. GMCNN comes to the rescue by not only fixing the missing parts but also making sure the fixed image looks natural and seamless.

So, what makes GMCNN special? Unlike regular image-fixing tools, it doesn't just look at the surface level of the image. Instead, it digs deep, understanding both the small details and the bigger picture. It's like having multiple experts working together, each focusing on a different aspect of the image repair job.

Now, let's talk about how it works. The magic happens through a clever mix of advanced machine learning (ML) and other smart techniques (non-ML). While ML takes care of understanding and fixing the image, other parts of the project handle tasks like preparing the data, refining the results, and making sure everything runs smoothly. This teamwork ensures that even tricky situations, like parts of the image being hidden or having complex patterns, can be handled with ease. Imagine using this technology yourself. You could simply paint over the damaged parts of the image, and GMCNN would seamlessly fill in the missing pieces, almost like magic. And the best part? You don't need to be a tech expert to use it – it's designed to be user-friendly and accessible to everyone. The demo is as below, which is captured by the official github (https://github.com/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn/).

## Discussion of engineering or process decisions 
### Design Decisions for Quality
Quality is paramount when it comes to fixing up images. But how do we make sure the results look as good as possible? Well, it all boils down to some important decisions made during the design process.

One big decision involves choosing the right "loss functions." Now, don't let the technical jargon scare you – these are just fancy tools that help us measure how accurate and lifelike the fixed images are. By using smart loss functions like perceptual loss and adversarial loss, we can make sure that the repaired areas of the image look just like they're supposed to, both in terms of meaning and visual appeal.

But that's not all – there are other design choices that also play a big role. Things like how deep the network goes, how big its "receptive fields" are (which basically means how much of the image it can see at once), and whether it pays extra attention to certain parts of the picture all contribute to making sure the final result is top-notch.

So, while it might seem like a lot of technical stuff, all these decisions are aimed at one simple goal: making sure that when you use this technology to fix up your images, the results are nothing short of stunning.


### Human-AI Interaction
In the world of image fixing, the way humans and AI work together is super important. Imagine having a magic wand that lets you tell the computer exactly what you want it to fix in your pictures – that's the kind of interaction we're talking about.

Instead of leaving the computer to do all the work on its own, we get to have a say in the process. With an interactive interface, we can point out which parts of the image need fixing or even tweak how detailed we want the fixes to be. This way, we make sure that the final result turns out just the way we want it. This project provides an interactive application, which users could directly paint images and start the model to recover the images. And here's the cool part – the better the communication between us and the AI, the better the results. When we can see what it's doing and understand why, it builds trust and makes the whole process feel smoother and more satisfying. So, by working together like this, we not only get awesome fixed images but also a great experience along the way.


## Conclusion
This project represent a significant advancement in the field of image inpainting, offering unprecedented capabilities for restoring missing or corrupted image regions. By understanding the architecture, design decisions, and implications of GMCNN-based inpainting systems, we can harness their full potential to create compelling and visually appealing results. As we continue to push the boundaries of AI-driven image restoration, the fusion of machine learning and human creativity promises a future where imperfections are seamlessly transformed into works of art.
